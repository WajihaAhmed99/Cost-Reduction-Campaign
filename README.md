high frequency. These factors lead to discontinuing the campaigns.

### Conclusion: 
Based on these visualizations, let's summarize the key points: 
#### Campaign 3: 
* Highest cost per click and cost per result among all campaigns, signaling 
inefficiency in budget utilization. Lower clicks indicate that the budget spent on 
this campaign is not yielding significant user engagement. 
#### Campaign 7: 
* Highest budget spends. Higher frequency and low click-through rate, suggest 
that the significant budget spent on Campaign 7 is not resulting in substantial 
user engagement. 
### Recommendation for Cost Reduction: 
While both Campaign 3 and Campaign 7 show inefficiencies, focusing on cost reduction 
makes Campaign 3 the primary candidate for discontinuation due to its higher cost 
per click and cost per result, signaling potential budget inefficiencies and lower user 
engagement.
